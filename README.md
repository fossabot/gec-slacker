# GEC Slacker

Take messages from an XSTREAM, and post to slack.

For the first message of $period (we use 30 minutes for not overloading messages in whatsapp, for instance), create a new slack message. For every other message, edit that post and update it.

Maybe the end of a message needs to include the scores/ labels we find; that way we surface what the model derives.
